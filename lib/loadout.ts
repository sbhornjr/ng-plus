Based on their gaming data, write 2-3 sentences that capture who they are as a gamer. Be specific, use their actual data, and make it feel personal and a little fun — like a character description. Don't be generic. Don't use phrases like "based on your data" or "according to your stats." Just describe them directly as a gamer. Write in second person — use "you" and "your", not "they" or "their". Address the user directly.

Here is their data:
- Username: ${data.username}
- Total games in library: ${data.totalGames}
- Completed games: ${data.completedGames} (${Math.round((data.completedGames / data.totalGames) * 100)}% completion rate)
- Average rating: ${data.avgRating}/10 across ${data.totalRatings} rated games
- Top genres by weighted rating: ${topGenresSummary}
- Favorite developers: ${topDevsSummary}

Write the identity paragraph now. 2-3 sentences max. No header, no label, just the paragraph.`
